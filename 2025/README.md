Algorithmic solutions for Advent of Code challenges, emphasizing efficient data structures and clean code practices.

## 📖 About
This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) programming puzzles. The goal is to track progress in algorithmic problem-solving and maintain a clean, professional codebase for competitive programming challenges.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure
The repository is organized by year and then by day. Each solution folder contains the source code and a summary of the problem.
